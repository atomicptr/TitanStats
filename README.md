# Titan Stats

A [PAYDAY 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/) mod, which adds more informations to the stats screen (TAB).

## Install

Intended to be installed via [BLT](http://paydaymods.com/). You'll need a directory structure which kinda looks like this:

    PAYDAY 2/mods
    PAYDAY 2/mods/Titan Stats
    PAYDAY 2/mods/Titan Stats/mod.txt
    PAYDAY 2/mods/Titan Stats/titan_stats.lua

The mod will probably work fine without BLT too, you just need to figure out yourself how to install it.

## Note

This mod might collide with other mods that try to use the stats screen.
